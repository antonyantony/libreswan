 *
 * shunk_t's buffer is of type 'char' (which may or may not be signed)

 * If INPUT contains a character from the DELIM set, return the

 * If INPUT is the null_shunk, return the null_shunk as the next
 * TOKEN, string remains unchanged (still the null_shunk).

 * character; should this be made an explict parameter.
