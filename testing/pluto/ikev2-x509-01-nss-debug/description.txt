Running with NSS debugging. This requires rebuild nss
packages with BUILD_OPT unset in the spec file.

You can find those for f28/f29 at https://nohats.ca/nss/

This test also sets all known maybe related environment variables supported,
which also activate the nss debug logging, and throw it to console to see.

This test should not be added to TESTLIST because the nss output has pointers in it.
