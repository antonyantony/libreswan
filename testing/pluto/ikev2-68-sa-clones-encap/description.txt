Install N per CPU Child SAs + one catch all SA with ESP in UDP encapsulation.

This one force UDP encapsulation, known to help with some cards such as i40E.
The receiver is likely to put the different ESP flows, sub SA, in to different
RSS Qs, hence likely to be distributed to different CPU.
You can either force this or would happen when there is NAT.

RFC 7296 2.8
"IKEv2 deliberately allows parallel SAs with the same Traffic Selectors between common endpoints."

This test need kernel/xfrm support to distribute traffic N CPU, using N per CPU sub SAs.
