 # Use CMP not DIFF.  When there's a difference, the output from diff
west #
 # mixed in with the output from comparing console.txt files looks too
west #
 # much like console.txt needs updating when it doesn't.

 # To update OUTPUT.enumcheck.txt run something like:
west #
 # $ ./OBJ.linux.x86_64/testing/enumcheck/enumcheck > testing/enumcheck/OUTPUT.enumcheck.txt
west #
 # $ git diff
west #
 ipsec enumcheck | cmp ../../enumcheck/OUTPUT.enumcheck.txt - || echo "Does the file OUTPUT.enumcheck.txt need updating?"
